                <p>I've developed the Smart Blind Stick, and here it is. It uses ultrasonic sensors, which you can see at the bottom, to detect obstacles and alert the user through vibrations or sounds. The GPS module helps with navigation, and there's an emergency alert system that can send the user's location to pre-set contacts. It also has light sensors to detect changes in ambient light. The whole system is powered by a rechargeable battery, ensuring reliable support throughout the day, significantly improving safety and independence for visually impaired users.

                <p>I've developed a Smart Security System designed to enhance the safety of homes and offices. It features motion sensors to detect unauthorized movement and send instant alerts to your smartphone.You can access remotely through a mobile message. It also has an audible alarm that activates during an intrusion and smart door locks that you can control remotely. For Future Development We can add like smoke and gas sensor, sending notifications if any hazardous conditions are detected. The system integrates with emergency services for rapid response and ensures a user-friendly experience through its message, providing real-time notifications and system status updates. This comprehensive solution significantly boosts security, offering peace of mind and reliable protection
